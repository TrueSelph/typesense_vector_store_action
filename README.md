JIVAS action wrapper around the Typesense vector database for retrieval-augmented generation tasks.

## Package Information

- **Name:** `jivas/typesense_vector_store_action`
- **Author:** [V75 Inc.](https://v75inc.com/)
- **Architype:** `TypesenseVectorStoreAction`

## Meta Information

- **Title:** Typesense Vector Store Action
- **Group:** core
- **Type:** vector_store_action

## Configuration

- **Singleton:** true

## Dependencies

- **Jivas:** `^2.0.0`
- **Pip:**
  - `typesense`: `0.21.0`

This package, developed by V75 Inc., provides integration with the Typesense vector database, supporting retrieval-augmented generation tasks. As a core vector store action, it enables efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation of vector data within the Typesense ecosystem. Configured as a singleton, it requires the Jivas library version 2.0.0 and the `typesense` Python package version 0.21.0 to function effectively.

## How to Use

Below is detailed guidance on how to configure and use the Typesense Vector Store Action.

### Overview

The Typesense Vector Store Action provides an abstraction layer for interacting with the Typesense vector database. It supports multiple configurations for various use cases, including:

- **Document storage and retrieval** for vector-based search.
- **Integration** with Typesense for efficient vector operations.
- **Pipeline management** for chaining multiple vector operations.

---

### Configuration Structure

The configuration consists of the following components:

### `typesense_settings`

Defines the settings for the Typesense database, such as host, API keys, and parameters.

```python
typesense_settings = {
    "host": "your_typesense_host",       # Example: "localhost" or "xxx.a1.typesense.net"
    "port": "8108",                      # Example: "8108" or "443" for Typesense Cloud
    "protocol": "http",                  # Example: "http" or "https" for Typesense Cloud
    "api_key": "your_api_key",           # API key for Typesense
    "connection_timeout": 2,             # Timeout in seconds
    "collection_name": "your_collection" # Name of the Typesense collection
}
```

---

### Example Configurations

### Basic Configuration for Typesense

```python
typesense_settings = {
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": "8108",
    "protocol": "http",
    "api_key": "your_typesense_api_key",
    "connection_timeout": 2,
    "collection_name": "example_collection"
}
```

### Best Practices
- Validate your API keys and Typesense settings before deployment.
- Test pipelines in a staging environment before production use.
